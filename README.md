Genetic Algorithm 

Genetic Algorithm is a randomised heuristic search strategy.

Focus is on evolving a population from which strong and diverse candidates can emerge via mutation and crossover (mating).


Genetic Algo is a variant of stochastic beam search in which successor states are generated by modifying two parent states rather than one.

Binary representation is used to represent the candidates



Basic algorithm

1.Create an initial population, either random or
  “blank”.

2.While the best candidate so far is not a
  solution:

    -Create new population using successor functions.

    -Evaluate the fitness of each candidate in the
    population.

3.Return the best candidate found.


Basic components

1.Candidate representation

    Important to choose this well. More work here means
    less work on the successor functions.

2.Successor function(s)

    Mutation, crossover

3.Fitness function

4.Solution test

5.Some parameters

6.Population size

7.Generation limit
